        <p>We want to enthusiastically express our satisfaction with the 751 Realty Team! Jenna and Jim acted like pros from start to finish! We listed a 3/4 acre lot for sale with another realtor as the market was headed to its apex. The lot was located in a hot exclusive golf course community with million plus dollar homes and land was becoming scarce. This realtor sent weekly articles about how hot the market was yet in the entire time she managed our listing I believe the lot was shown just a few times. Almost a year and a half later ZERO interest. We left that realtor in the dust and sought out the 751 Realty Team and voila the lot was sold in 20 days at top dollar. Their knowledge of the ins and outs of the listing process was vast as indicated by the fabulous results. Don't waste your time with amateur realtors go to the "A" team... The 751 Realty Team! Trust us you wont regret it!<br><strong>- Chris and Anna O., Property Sellers</strong></p>

        <p>They were amazing! Always responded within minutes if contacted by email, always available on the phone no matter what time we needed them. They were very helpful and explained very clearly the entire process, showed us all the houses we wanted, and finally helped us buy our home. The most honest and reliable real estate team you could find.<br><strong>- Christian B., First-Time Home Buyer</strong></p>

        <p>What can I say? I was in a seller's market when I bought my house. This means multiple offers and bidding wars. Even though I was facing this unfortunate circumstance as a buyer, Jenna helped me get through. Jenna truly cares about her clients. There were numerous occasions where she could help me close "Okay" and "Questionable" deals for an easy profit, yet she went extra mile to help me find the perfect house for my family with her aggressive and keen strategies. Speaking of extra mile, Jenna showed me a property literally the day before her wedding, and she probably had her wedding dress in her trunk during that showing. It's rare to find that kind of dedication in a real estate agent. Jenna was also giving me a moral boost when I was about to give up after getting shot down in multiple bidding situations. She is an expert in local real estate knowledge, and she also has an excellent network with high quality specialists such as attorney, inspector, etc. I highly recommend Jenna to anyone who is looking into buying a house.<br><strong>- Youn C., First-Time Home Buyer</strong></p>

        <p>I can't recommend Jenna enough, she helped us find the home we wanted and was extremely professional and knowledgeable along the way. When it seemed like it wouldn't be possible, she was patient and calm, and the perfect home came available. Through her hard work and hustle we were able to get our offer in after hours and beat other offers to the table. Thanks Jenna-Leigh!<br><strong>- Jonathan C., Relocation Home Buyer</strong></p>

        <p>Jenna-Leigh was amazing to work with! I was a first time home buyer who knew nothing about the process of buying a home. During my initial meeting with Jenna-Leigh, she gradually talked me through each step of the process and explained everything in such a way that made complete sense to me. Any questions I had going in, quickly went away. She was able to connect me with a mortgage lender, who helped me determine my price range. I then perused the many listings on-line that Jenna-Leigh had narrowed down for me, based on my wish-list, to come up with the list of properties I wanted to see firsthand. She promptly set up visits to the homes I wanted to see all in one day, which was great, because it was easy to compare them. While on the site visits she thoroughly explained what things to look for (when was the last time the roof/HVAC/water heater/etc... were replaced) and what things should be considered "red flags". I continually learned something new after each encounter with Jenna-Leigh. I quickly found the perfect house for me and she successfully helped me negotiate the price down to where I needed it to be. I was mostly impressed by her responsiveness throughout the entire process. I would highly recommend Jenna-Leigh to anyone!<br><strong>- Ted L., First-Time Home Buyer</strong></p>

        <p>Jenna was fantastic to work with. She was always available when we needed her. Very reliable, friendly, and knowledgeable. We had a tight time frame to work with and she was very accommodating and helped us find a rental home in the price range and area we were looking for. We love Jenna!<br><strong>- Nathan L., Home Rental</strong></p>
